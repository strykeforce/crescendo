# Naming Standards

## Interfaces
For any subsystem that follows a general pattern, it must implement one of the interfaces:
    - Closed Loop Position Subsystem
    - Closed Loop Speed Subsystem
    - Open Loop Subsystem

## Auton Paths
ADD ONCE PATHS ARE MADE

## State Subsystems
Naming standards for every subsystem that uses State machines:
    
    - For State Enum (Public):
        {Class Name Without Subsystem} + States 
            (ex. in MagazineSubsytem, MagazineStates would follow the standard)

    - For State Variables (Private):
        curState
    
    - For Storing The Next State (Private):
        nextState

    - For Getting/Setting Variables (Public):
        getState
        setState
        getNextState
        setNextState

## Variable Naming
General private variables should share these names:

    - For setpoint variables (Private):
        setpoint    - Closed loop position or closed loop speed

## Subsystem Layout
Every subsystem should follow the same basic layout:

    - Private Variables
    - Constructor
    - Getter/Setter Methods
    - Helper Methods
    - Periodic Function
    - Grapher Function
    - State Enum

## Function Naming
Certain functions should share similar naming patterns:

    - Getter Method
        get{What Variable is Storing} (ex. getting the setpoint variable - getPosition())

    - Setter Method
        set{What Variable is Storing} (ex. setting the setpoint variable - setPosition())


## Comments
Comments should be placed in locations that allow readers to easily identify what code blocks do without reading them. Comments need to easily describe what something does without over describing it (ex. commenting a for loop that runs 4 times as "// Runs 4 times" is redundant).
